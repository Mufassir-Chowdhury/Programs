There are many standards for C language.<br/>
<br/>
1. GCC<br/>
<br/>
It's a compiler collection and a toolchain. the GCC is a foundation that can be used to implement any compiler of any language for any hardware platform and any operating system and it can be used to implement a cross compiler. It'a free and was created by Richard Stallman in May 23. 1987. It was first called GNU C Compiler and then changed into GNU Compiler Collection.<br/>
<br/>
2. CLANG<br/>
<br/>
It's part of the LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) project. It's free too and has tested to be faster than GCC.<br/>
<br/>
3. ICC<br/>
<br/>
ICC is short for Intel C Compiler and is highly optimized for Intel processors. Intel claims that it's binary code is 50% faster than that generated by GCC or MS compilers.<br/>
<br/>
4. XL C/C++ compiler<br/>
<br/>
It's also a specialized and optimized compiler but for IBM hardware.<br/>
<br/>
5. Microsoft C/C++ compiler<br/>
<br/>
Created in 1983 . Later it changed it's name to CL.<br/>
<br/>
6. Watcom C compiler<br/>
<br/>
Created by watcom International Corporation in 1988. It was closed at first then it became free. It's still under continuous development.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that a program written for a compiler works differently or doesn't work at all in other compiler.<br/>
<br/>
There are two international bodies who control the development of C language.<br/>
<br/>
1. ANSI <br/>
<br/>
American National Standards Institute established in 1918 with headquarters in Washington, DC.<br/>
<br/>
2. ISO<br/>
<br/>
International Organization for Standardization established in 1947 with headquarters in Geneve, Switzerland. It is present in 162 countries. And the ISO is not an abbreviation but rather just a name.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning, the language had no standards and no official documents. The standard was served by a book authored by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, titled the C Programming Language and published for the first time in 1978. This version was called K&amp;R &quot;C&quot;<br/>
The first document was published by ANSI in 1989 and was titled ANSI X3.159-1989 &quot;Pogramming Language C&quot;. It was reffered to ANSI C and also C89.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The computers can be thought of 2 types. They differ in the way in which multibyte data is arranged in the memory. <br/>
- Machines using the <b>lilttle endian </b>places the lower byte containing the less significant bits at the lesser address. And Machines using the <b>big endian </b>containing the more significant bits at the geater address. For example, the number 1 in the little endian will be stored as,<br/>
<br/>
<tt>	0x01000000<br/>
<br/>
</tt>instead of<br/>
<br/>
		<tt>0x00000001<br/>
</tt><tt><br/>
</tt>In 1990, ISO adopted the ANSI C standard and after some changes, published it as ISO/IEC 9899:1990 which was later called C90. The C89 and C90 was in fact the same standard.<br/>
<br/>
In 1995, ISO published an extended emendment to the C90 standard released as ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 and was adopted under the code name C95. It included-<ul><li>Wide characters</li>
<li>Digraphs</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The C99 standard standard was introduced in 2000 by the document ISO/IEC 9899:1999. It included-<ul><li>New data types</li>
<li>Static array indices, designated initializers, compound literals, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, variadic macros and the <tt>restrict </tt>keyword</li>
<li>C++ styled comments</li>
<li>for loops with internal control variable declaration.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The C11 is the last C standard by the document ISO/IEC 9899:2011. It included-<ul><li>Unicode support</li>
<li>the _Generic keyword</li>
<li>Platform independent multi-threading tools</li>
<li>Generic types</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
How to know the version you are using:<ul><li>The C89/C90 defines a symbol __STDC__</li>
<li>The value of __STDC_VERSION__ for C95 should be 199409L</li>
<li>The value of __STDC_VERSION__ for C99 should be 199901L</li>
<li>The value of __STDC_VERSION__ for C11 should be 201112L</li>
</ul>
