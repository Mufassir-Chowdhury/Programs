<title>2.1 Calling conventions</title>
</head><body>- <b>Caller </b>or <b>Invoker </b>is a <b>function which calls another function. </b>This is responsible for preparing arguments and receiving the result.<br/>
- <b>Callee </b>or <b>Invokee </b>is a <b>function being called. </b>This is responsible for intercepting arguments, associating them with parameters, and preparing and returning the result.<br/>
- The way in which <b>caller </b>and <b>callee </b>communicates is called the <b>calling convention.<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>A separate part of the memory named <b>stack </b>is used to transfer argumment values from caller to callee. Processor provides at least two instructions named <tt>push </tt>and <tt>pop </tt>to <b>put a value on a stack </b>and to <b>get a value from the stack.<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>The <b>caller </b>pushes the argument on the stack, the <b>callee </b>makes use of them, and someone removes them from the stac.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments may be pushed in the order of the passed arguments and the callee may be responsible for cleaning the stacks. This convention is called <b>Pascal </b>and avoided in modern C compilers.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments may be pushed in the order of the passed arguments and the caller may be responsible for cleaning the stacks. This convention is called <b>stdcall. <br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>The arguments may be pushed in the opposite order of the passed arguments and the caller may be responsible for cleaning the stack. This convention is called <b>cdecl.<br/>
